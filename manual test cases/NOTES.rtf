I have changed the App\'92s API Key. When I first ran the app, on both emulators and USB device, the maps did not show. I checked and installed all required add-ons for Android Studio and then on the devices, nothing worked. After going through the logs I could see that the API Key was not authorised. The maps now work as expected.\
